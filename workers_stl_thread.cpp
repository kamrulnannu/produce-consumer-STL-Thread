         * necessary between detached threads and main thread via mutex and condition_variable.
         *
         * For this example project, we are synchonizing worker threads
         * with main thread using a mutex and condition_variable. main
         * thread will wait in Workers::Wait() until all items in m_WorkItems are consumed
         * by workers. Worker thread will notify main when all items are
         * consumed in queue. So, we'll not have incorrect result.
